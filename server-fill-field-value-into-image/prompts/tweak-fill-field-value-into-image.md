Improve the original prompt in `fill-field-value-into-image.md` by analyzing discrepancies between the original image and the image rendered from the generated HTML, then updating the prompt to address these issues.

## Inputs

- Original Image: The source image that needs field values filled in.
- Rendered Image: The image generated by rendering the HTML produced using the current prompt.

## Steps

1. **Analyze Images**:
   - Compare the original image and the rendered image.
   - Identify visual differences, such as layout mismatches, font issues, color discrepancies, positioning errors, or any other rendering problems.
   - Note any missing or incorrectly placed field values.
   - Consider aspects like image dimensions, HTML structure integrity, and printability to PDF.
   
   - **Do not use the original image as a background image in the generated HTML.** The original image must be reproduced using HTML/CSS elements (images should be converted into HTML structure where text and shapes are recreated using HTML elements whenever possible).

2. **Identify Prompt Issues**:
   - Determine how the current prompt in `fill-field-value-into-image.md` contributes to these discrepancies.
   - Suggest improvements to the prompt's instructions, such as adding more detailed guidelines on HTML structure, styling, field placement, or validation steps.

3. **Update the Prompt**:
   - Propose specific changes to the `fill-field-value-into-image.md` file.
   - Ensure updates maintain the original objective while enhancing accuracy and fidelity to the original image.
   - Use full-width punctuation for Chinese text if applicable, and standard punctuation for English.

4. **Output the Updated Prompt**:
   - Provide the full updated content of the `fill-field-value-into-image.md` file with the proposed changes.

## Considerations

- Focus on making the prompt more precise to ensure the generated HTML closely matches the original image visually.
- Test any suggested changes mentally to verify they would resolve the identified issues.
- Keep updates concise and targeted.
- If no issues are found, state that and suggest no changes.
