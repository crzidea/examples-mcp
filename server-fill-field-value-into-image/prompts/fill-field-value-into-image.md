# Fill Field Values into Image

## Objective

The goal is to fill specific field values into an image by leveraging a multi-modal LLM to convert the image into an HTML format, retrieving the necessary field values, and then embedding these values into the HTML.

## Steps

1. **Convert Image to HTML**: 
   - Utilize the capabilities of a multi-modal LLM to convert the image into an HTML format. This will allow for easy manipulation and insertion of field values.

2. **Retrieve Field Values**:
   - Utilize the MCP tool `get_example_field_values` to obtain the necessary field values. Ensure that the tool is correctly configured and that the values are retrieved in the expected format.

3. **Fill Field Values into HTML**:
   - Insert the retrieved field values into the corresponding fields within the HTML. Ensure that the values are placed accurately and that the HTML structure is maintained.

## Considerations

- Ensure that the HTML conversion maintains the visual integrity of the original image.
- Ensure that the HTML page size matches the image's height and width.
- Validate the field values before insertion to prevent any errors or inconsistencies.
- Ensure the HTML content is capable of being converted to PDF and printed.
- Test the final output to ensure that the field values are correctly displayed in the image.
